# LANE-ASSIST
                                                      Lane Detection
      ⇒ By camera
      ⇒ Python/matlab
      ⇒ Algorithms:
        ⇒ CANNY
        ⇒ Hough transformation
      ⇒ Additionals:
        ⇒ Warning generation
        ⇒ Sound response if object is 0.4 km away from camera
        ⇒ Auto Detect Parking ( P ) on lanes


#Phase 1:	30 APRIL

1.	By camera image capture ( idk how but have to do this part )
2.	Algo coding CANNY and HOUGH
3.	Combining both and generating the output

#Phase 2:	5 MAY

1.	Waring
2.	Sound
3. 	P detection yeh wo kar sakta jo algos lekhay ga

#Phase3:	7th MAY

1.	Report making
2.	Presentation making
3. 	Project finalization
